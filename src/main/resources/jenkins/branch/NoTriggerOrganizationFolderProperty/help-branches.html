<div>
    Allows you to control the SCM commit trigger coming from branch indexing.
    Supply a regular expression of branch names, for example <code>(?!release.*).*</code> or <code>PR-\d+</code>.
    Matching branches will be triggered automatically.
    (You may still build other branches manually or via CLI/REST.)
